Instructions for running the project:
=====================================

1 - unzipping the auto-parking-flask.zip;

2- open a terminal/cmd window on the Project root folder "auto-parking-flask", where you should see the file "Dockerfile";

3 - Execute docker to build an image of my project with the command line (without quotes): "docker build -t auto-parking ." ;

4 - Run the image with the command: "docker run -d -p 5000:5000 auto-parking" ;

5 - the Application "Auto Parking" should be accessible through the URL: "http://0.0.0.0:5000", and/or "http://127.0.0.1:5000" it 
depends on your docker engine configuration;

Obs: The Application DB is provided by Google Cloud Platform: Firebase - Realtime Database, and I'd some data already inserted.  

6 - You may log in with: 
user: heitor

or if you prefer, you may create your own user through the URL: "http://0.0.0.0:5000/auth/register" and log in with your very own account.

===================================
Executing test_parking_app.py file
===================================

Once you have your docker image running, the testing script can be executed through the application container. 

1 - run the command "docker ps" and look for the Container Name which was attributed to auto-parking, and copy it;

2 - Paste the container on the following command, replacing the "<container_name>" with the one you've copied. 
"docker exec <container_name> python test_parking_app.py" ;

3 - copy and paste the command into your terminal, and execute it.
